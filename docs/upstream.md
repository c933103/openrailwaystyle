# Upstream project and original examples

[Documentation index](README.md) · [Project overview](../README.md)

This fork originated in **Open Railway Styles**. The following project background and original tile-building approach are retained for reference. The worldwide Atlas does not run the Europe extractor.

Design a style for railways using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

Most maps favour only roads. We want to display railway information as a base map.

Too many railway services use a general purpose OpenStreetMap base layer (or even worse, a proprietary map from a GAFAM company) and this project aims to change that.

As the [OpenRailwayMap](https://www.openrailwaymap.org/) project shows, OpenStreetMap has a lot of information that can be used to design a nice looking general purpose railway base map.

In this project we provide:
- a style that focuses on showing railway infrastructure,
- a script that extracts the needed railway data from OpenStreetMap (with certain specific tags) and generates a [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles),
- a demonstration webpage to explore the style.

## Background

This project has been initiated during the [Hack4Rail 2025](https://hack4rail.event.sbb.ch/en/), a joint hackathon organized by the railway companies SBB, ÖBB, and DB in partnership with the OpenRail Association.

Three teams tackled the challenge under different angles (focus on a specific zoom level, different use cases…). Their results can be found here:

* [Infra Viewers](https://openrail-playground.github.io/openrailwaystyle/infra_viewers.html)
* [European Train Spotter](https://openrail-playground.github.io/openrailwaystyle/european_train_spotter.html)
* [Openstreet Trainsformer](https://openrail-playground.github.io/openrailwaystyle/openstreet_trainsformer.html)

## How does it work?

Maps on the web are nowadays generally rendered on the browser with a library such as [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js).

The data is pre-processed into [Vector Tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vector_tiles) to only access to the needed data at a given coordinate and zoom level (when displaying Europe, we don’t need the position of every tree).

Similarly, only some tags from OpenStreetMap are used. There are conventions such as [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/schema/) that define what tags are included.

The usual data schemas do not contain enough detail for the railway-specific rendering in this project.

For this preprocessing, we use the tool [planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler). The file [ProcessRailway.java](../ProcessRailway.java) contains all the specific configuration.

Read the [justfile](../justfile) to see how to run the processing different steps.

## Going further

The project focuses on the physical representation of rail networks. However, travelers often need information about commercial lines.
The [publication of Patrick Brosi and Hannah Bast](https://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Large-Scale_Generation_of_Transit_Maps_from_OpenStreetMap_Data.pdf) could be considered to transform the physical layer to have more information.
