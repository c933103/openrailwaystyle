# Data sources and maintenance

## Sources and attribution

The quiet base-map layers, colours and design originate in this repository. Its global base source is `https://tuiles.enliberte.fr/planet.pmtiles`. Railway data comes from the independently hosted [OpenRailwayMap vector service](https://openrailwaymap.app/), whose [usage policy](https://github.com/hiddewie/OpenRailwayMap-vector/blob/master/USAGE.md) permits clearly attributed public applications without registration. The site loads only the current view and has no offline downloader or tile prefetcher. Attribution remains visible on the map and in About & data. The site does not copy the provider’s GPL rendering code; its new railway styling is independently authored against the documented tile fields.

The repository code is licensed under [Apache 2.0](../LICENSE). Map data and third-party assets retain their own licences and attribution requirements. Lifecycle and street-running GeoJSON databases are distributed under ODbL; see their manifests and downloads under **About & data**. Terrain sources are credited in [terrain-credits.html](../styles/terrain-credits.html), and language-boundary sources are detailed in [label regions](labels.md#geographic-regions-and-boundary-sources).

## Railway lifecycle snapshot

The maintenance build (`.github/workflows/snapshot.yml`) extracts disjoint world regions sequentially, subdivides dense regions when necessary, deduplicates OSM way IDs, retains name translations, and produces a PMTiles archive plus an ODbL GeoJSON database. It refuses to publish an incomplete extraction and checks the north–south extent of 남부내륙선.

The manifest records each region’s OSM timestamp and feature count. The `rail-data` branch stores the published files; ordinary site builds unpack the archive into compressed static vector tiles without rerunning extraction. A compact tile index skips empty areas. This avoids GitHub Pages’ unreliable compressed archive range responses; the browser decodes whole tile files instead.

The raw Overpass responses are kept in the `overpass-cache` release (the Actions cache expires after a week unused), so a rebuild after a change to `scripts/lifecycle.mjs` needs no Overpass queries.

A scheduled run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 03:23 UTC (night across Europe, where most users of the public Overpass server are) asks Overpass only for ways changed since the previous run (`scripts/snapshot-delta.mjs`): changed planned, construction and former ways with geometry, and the IDs of changed operating ways, so a line that opens disappears from the snapshot within a few days.

It also re-downloads the oldest ~5 MB of full region responses (`scripts/refresh-snapshot-cache.mjs`), catching what change queries miss, such as deleted ways (the whole world is renewed about every eight weeks), and fetches the loading gauge of every railway way as a CSV list of way IDs (`scripts/build-loading-gauge-list.mjs`, about 4 MB), which colours the zoom 0–6 overview of the Loading gauge view, since no overview tiles carry loading gauge.

A run is about 40 queries and 10 MB, within the Overpass API wiki's guidance for regular applications (under 100 queries and 10 MB a day); a region file larger than 5 MB still goes whole, so an occasional run is larger. Map visitors never query Overpass.

Each run publishes the snapshot and redeploys the site; the manifest records each region's OSM date and the time changes were applied up to. `rail-data` is replaced by a single commit on each publish, so the repository keeps only the current snapshot.

For faster global refreshes, use planet/regional dumps or your own Overpass instance rather than querying public servers more often.

## Polar caps

Web Mercator tiles, which every map source here uses, end at 85.05° N and S; on the globe the two caps beyond (about 550 km across from each pole) are drawn from data prepared for them in a polar projection (`scripts/build-polar.mjs`, published with the railway snapshot): water, ice shelves, runways and place names from OpenStreetMap, and relief shading and contours from NOAA ETOPO 2022 (60 arc-second), in the same colours as the rest of the map, with the detail of equatorial zoom 8 (the rest of the map's coarsest contour step) kept when zoomed further in.

The lifecycle workflow prepares these assets with `scripts/build-polar.mjs`. OpenStreetMap cap queries are renewed every four weeks; source data are cached. If a source is unavailable the cached copy is used, and without one the optional cap assets are omitted.

## Street-running snapshot

The workflow [street-running.yml](../.github/workflows/street-running.yml) runs weekly on Sunday at 03:27 UTC and can be run manually. It builds a validated worldwide Overpass extract of explicitly mapped shared roadway, then publishes the complete tiles atomically to `street-data`. Failed refreshes retain the last published snapshot.

Each website build copies `12/`, `index.json`, `manifest.json` and `street-running.geojson.gz` into `styles/data/street-running/`. The manifest and ODbL GeoJSON download are linked under About. Visitors do not make Overpass requests. See [rail-road rendering](rendering.md#rail-road-interfaces) for qualifying tags and display zooms.

## Published data and caches

| Location | Contents | Updated by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rail-data` branch | Lifecycle archive parts, manifest, loading-gauge list and optional polar assets | `snapshot.yml` |
| `street-data` branch | Street-running static tiles, index, manifest and GeoJSON | `street-running.yml` |
| `overpass-cache` release | Raw responses for rebuilding the lifecycle snapshot | `snapshot.yml` |
| `styles/data/` in the built site | Assembled published snapshots | `site.yml` |

Use the published snapshots for local development; [setup instructions](development.md#load-published-map-data) avoid a new worldwide extraction. The workflows are the executable source of truth for schedules and publishing steps; update this guide when they change.
